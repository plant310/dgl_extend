    The "node_type" points to a list of all the node names present in the graph
    And "num_nodes_per_chunk" is used to mention no. of nodes present in each of the
    input nodes files. These node counters are used to compute the type_node_ids as
    well as global node-ids by using a simple cumulative summation and maitaining an
    offset counter to store the end of the current.

    Since nodes are NOT actually associated with any additional metadata, w.r.t to the processing
    involved in this pipeline this information is not needed to be stored in files. This optimization
    saves a considerable amount of time when loading massively large datasets for paritioning. 
    As opposed to reading from files and performing shuffling process each process/rank generates nodes
    which are owned by that particular rank. And using the "num_nodes_per_chunk" information each
    process can easily compute any nodes per-type node_id and global node_id.
    The node-ids are treated as int64's in order to support billions of nodes in the input graph.

    Code below is used to read edges from the input dataset with the help of the metadata json file
    for the input graph dataset. 
    In the metadata json file, we expect the following key-value pairs to help read the edges of the 
    input graph. 

    "edge_type" : [ # a total of n edge types
        canonical_etype_0, 
        canonical_etype_1, 
        ..., 
        canonical_etype_n-1
    ]

    The value for the key is a list of strings, each string is associated with an edgetype in the input graph.
    Note that these strings are in canonical edgetypes format. This means, these edge type strings follow the
    following naming convention: src_ntype:etype:dst_ntype. src_ntype and dst_ntype are node type names of the 
    src and dst end points of this edge type, and etype is the relation name between src and dst ntypes. 

    The files in which edges are present and their storage format are present in the following key-value pair: 
    
    "edges" : {
        "canonical_etype_0" : {
            "format" : { "name" : "csv", "delimiter" : " " }, 
            "data" : [
                filename_0, 
                filename_1, 
                filename_2,

                filename_<p-1>
            ]
        },
    }

    As shown above the "edges" dictionary value has canonical edgetypes as keys and for each canonical edgetype
    we have "format" and "data" which describe the storage format of the edge files and actual filenames respectively. 
    Please note that each edgetype data is split in to `p` files, where p is the no. of partitions to be made of
    the input graph.

    Each edge file contains two columns representing the source per-type node_ids and destination per-type node_ids
    of any given edge. Since these are node-ids as well they are read in as int64's.
